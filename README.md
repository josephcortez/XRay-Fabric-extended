# Advanced XRay Extended (Fabric Edition)

Hello! This is a fork of [`Michael Hillcox's Advanced XRay Mod`](https://github.com/MichaelHillcox/XRay-Fabric)

This version has some additional features I wanted to create for my own use. This version is only for Fabric 1.18.2. Please feel free to download this and use it for yourself but similarly to the original creator, I don't endorse cheating on multiplayer servers!

Fabric Loader based XRay mod designed to aid players who don't like the ore searching process. This mod is an exact 1:1 copy of his [Advanced XRay Forge Mod](https://github.com/MichaelHillcox/XRay-Mod/) which is typically the more up-to-date version of the mod.

Please refer to the first link to see the original documentation!
